Although, live in the second hour we’re going to have a chat to the girls from t.A.T.u who are upstairs at the moment at Capital and they’re going to, they’re going to pop down and have a little chat with us. So we’re really trying to, you know, make this more of an interactive show. Um, uh, we don’t know yet whether we’re going to give up, uh, or not. It depends how this show goes. Um, yeah. Look forward to that, but we’ve got some great- we went down to the big library so we don’t have to rely on 4 Non Blondes and the, uh, you know, two Jam tracks that are up-up here.

And they can pinpoint when these monkeys, when one monkey first went down and got in the hot water springs and stayed there cause it was hot. And the others copied him and now it’s a, it’s part of, almost, a culture. You know? The-the- it won’t be handed on. Cause it’s not instinctive, but has to be learned each time. And, uh, you know. And the-the- they grew as normal like other monkeys, right? But they-they’re really intelligent and, um, obviously, the reason they groom other people- other, other monkeys is cause they eat the mites. But the- also, the monkeys have learned they like being groomed. Okay? So they showed this one monkey. It went to a deer, okay? And it was grooming this deer to get its mite off it, right? But then it didn’t eat it. It held it in its hand. It went over to a monkey, put the mite on itself to show the monkey it had a mite and got a free grooming."
