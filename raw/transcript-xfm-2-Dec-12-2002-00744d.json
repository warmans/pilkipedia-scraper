Uhm, we- Steve actually saw this thing in The Guardian, in the week, uh, about a research thing and then we looked up- we looked into it on Friday and it is incredible. Right, listen to this. There's, uhh, a thing in umm- umm in a bay in, umm, uhh, New England, right, where it's like the biggest, um, uh- they make silicon chips and stuff for computers, right. And cuz of the data protection thing, after they've d- done them, because they have to destroy the plates, right, where the information's, sort of, put onto them. But they're still flakes of silcon, they sort of grind it down straight away and some of the flakes got into the bay, okay. But, some of the information's still on the- even the s- slight granules of silicon. Anyway, gets in the water and silicon is rather like, um, a carbon derivative. They reckon if there'd been life on another planet that wasn't carbon-based, it'd be silcon-based. Cuz... simple sugars and protoz- it's just COH and that and it can work with silcon, right. Anyway, the crabs have been taking up- this gets underwater, and they- they looked out on the beach and, uhh- over the years the crabs had started, umm, sort of, putting themselves in formations like geometric forma- and they couldn't work it out why they were doing this. And uhh, when they put them in the experiment they, sort of, like, chopped 'em up and they found they'd taken on silicon... and it had, sort of, got into their brain and they were downloading information - they actually- they picked up little things because it's just chemical, umm, you know like, w- electrical impulses it'd... got information off the silcon chip and they were interfacin' it but - this is the amazing thing - one bloke, sort of, thought of this and he thought, \"Well, if- if this is a simple computer, the brain, if it's just a simple, sort of, electrical ... thing, then maybe there's- there's...\", you know, \"we could get it down\". So what- what they did is they made a thing called, \"a bio-interface\" and they- they put it into the crab's brain, just a really simple brain, into its medula oblongada, right. And it got impulses from it and they were getting... like computer readou- just flashes of like symbols and geometric things, right, on this screen to read the crab's brain and it was stuff like, you know, fragments of a, uhm--"

But the most amazing thing is - they downloaded a memory, right. It was like a- like a snapshot where it'd been burnt onto the retina of the crab - just a snapshot or sommat - and it was like a picture of the beach, like, a couple of years ago, right. And they also j- i- i- incredible it was like, just a digital black and white, sort of thing, so they could see what the crab had seen."
